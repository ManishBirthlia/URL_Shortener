### Project: URL Shortener

**Description:** 
Developed a URL shortener web application using Node.js and Express.js, leveraging MongoDB for database management. Integrated EJS for templating and Tailwind CSS for responsive styling. The application allows users to shorten long URLs into manageable links, tracks the number of clicks on each shortened link, and displays both the original and shortened URLs on the user interface. Implemented server-side logic for URL redirection and management of click counts using Mongoose schemas. Deployed and maintained the application on a local server environment for testing and development purposes.

**Technologies Used:** 
Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, EJS, Tailwind CSS

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed RESTful API endpoints for URL shortening and redirection.
- Integrated frontend design with EJS templates and styled components using Tailwind CSS.
- Implemented MongoDB schemas and models to store and retrieve shortened URLs and their associated analytics.
- Ensured responsive design and user-friendly experience across different devices.

**Outcome:**
The project demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, including backend server setup, database integration, API development, and frontend implementation with modern CSS frameworks.
